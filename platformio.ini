# Build naming conventions
# ------------------------
#
# Production
# A production build is what is expected to be put on a fully-working
# production device.
#
# Stub
# A stub build that forces the sensors to return 'good' values
# and permanently turn on the heartbeat module. Useful for
# debugging network connectivity.
